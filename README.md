# Default_Error_Page_Collection

This repository contains a collection of default error pages for web servers. The purpose of this repository is to provide a collection of default error pages for web servers that can be used for penetration testing and/or bug bounties to determine the technology used by the web server.

Hope this can help someone out there :>.
